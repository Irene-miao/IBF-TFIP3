I worked for many years in the education industry. It is inspiring in the beginning but slowly I get burnedout easily. 
I get to learn a lot of techniques and knowledge from co-workers and bosses which is enriching and aids in my development.
I always have an interest in technology such as web development and got my first experience of creating a simple Dreamweaver website in school.
